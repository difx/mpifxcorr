Version 1.5.3, current development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Bug fix for calculation of buffer sizes for Mk4/VLBA/VDIF format, which 
  could lead to MODE errors and the loss of a few FFTs in very rare cases

Version 1.5.2, 2009 Nov 23
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Warn when difxmessage is in use so the user knows why no messages appear on the screen
* Improved real-time correlation monitoring
* Primitive support for single-thread VDIF
* Support for unmodulated VLBA format (called VLBN internally)

Version 1.5.1, 2009 Sep 8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Mark5 bank switching more reliable
* Zero-weight data is not written

Version 1.5 Perth, 2008 March 7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This version was born from the merge of the main trunk code and Walter's
native-mark5 branch.  In addition some new features were added:

1. Input file

  * HEADER O/RIDE is removed (never used) and replaced with
VIS BUFFER LENGTH, which was a compile-time constant.  Typical values for
this number are upwards of 8.

  * In the configuration table, two additional parameters have been added
after NUM CHANNELS:

  CHANNELS TO AVERAGE
  OVERSAMPLE FACTOR

Currently both of these only accept value 1.

  * In the datastream table, the format and data source parameters have
changed.  The four following parameters are now used:

  DATA FORMAT
  QUANTIZATION BITS
  DATA FRAME SIZE
  DATA SOURCE

2. Difx format output

  * WEIGHTS WRITTEN replaced with DATA WEIGHT.  The value is a float ranging
from 0.0 to possibly a bit more than 1.0, but no more than 2.0; the average
weight over many seconds of data should not exceed 1.0.

  * Exactly NUM CHANNELS of data are written out.  For upper sideband data
the first written channel is the DC channel and for lower sideband data
the last written channel is the DC channel.  The Nyquist channel is always
dropped.

Nomenclature still version 1.5 - full name now 1.5.0 - 02 June 2009

  * Many bugfixes have been made and this version is now committed as the 
  "official" 1.5 branch release
