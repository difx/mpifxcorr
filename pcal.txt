PhaseCal pathway
================
Configuration::processDatastreamTable
+ get phasecalintervalmhz and check it's a positive integer

Configuration::populateResultLengths
- set up space at the end of results for phase cal values

Core::processdata
  //before processing
+ for all datastreams i
+   modes[i].resetpcal()
  //just before averageandsendAcorrs 
- averagePcals
  
Core::averagePcals //not yet written c.f. averageAndSendAutoCorrs
- extract pcal results
- average thread results
- copy to main results array

Mode::Mode
+ for each frequency
+   Work out the number of tones in each subband
+   Work out the pcaloffset in hz for each subband
+   Instantiate a PCal extractor
+   getLen of extractor
+ Instantiate pcalresults[nfreq][ntones]
  	
Mode::~Mode
+ delete extractors
+ delete pcalresults

Mode::process
+ for each frequency
+  if phase cal is on for this frequency
+   extract and integrate

Mode::resetpcal
+ for each frequency
+   PCal->clear()

FXManager

Visibility::Visibility
+ for each datastream
+   for each frequency
+     allocate one cf32 per pcal extracted

Visibility::~Visibility
+ delete pcal

Visibility::writedifx
+ open one pcal file for each antenna

Visibility::writedata
- write out data to disk
